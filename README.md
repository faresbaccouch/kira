A new Flutter project.

kira is game application made with flutter :

so basically the game is build from anime called kire where the character have shinigami and can kill people by writing their name in the death note , 
people sit next to each other create characters with their name thet press start ,
1- each player will take the phone see his role then press next and handover the phone to the next player,
-the game will give their character roles in the game, there is 12 characters
characters :
(kira team) there is characters to help kira named misa and the other will try to catch kira ,
kira can kill by picking the name,
(L team) the other characters  will provide information will lead to kira so they can know who got the kira role and kill him with the vote in the last of every round 

 the characters : 

            kira :
Write the player's name in the book to kill him, You can also hide the Death book by handing it over to someone, and when that person dies you get the Death book back,
       
            L :
You can choose a character to see his role

            Misa : 
You don't have the Death book but you do have a paper of it, help Kira
            kiraNews :
 this character show one of the following news : 
 "Kira still has the Death book","Kira does not have the Death Book" ,"Kira is Dead Help Them Catch misa"

            gameNews :
this character show one of the following news : 
for exemple : there is 1 fakename in this game Or There is no fakename in this game

            FBI : 
You must help the detectives catch Kira

            policman:
Choose a player to put him in jail for a day (can't vote)

            Commander:
Your vote counts as a value of two

            detective:
Choose players to see if they have a Death book

            shinigamiEye: 
You have 20 percent to see the Shinigami behind Kira

            fakeName:
You are an undercover investigator with a false name. Kira can't kill you,

             Near:
If L is dead, You can see Players roles

all players see their roles then try to catch kira with the information provided they can kill kira with the votes if the team fail to catch kira in the first day (more then 2 player survive with kira ) the day 2 come with the same logic
